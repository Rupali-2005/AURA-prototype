# AURA — Career Alignment System

[Link : AURA Demo](https://aura-prototype-v1.vercel.app/) 

AURA is an AI-powered prototype designed to help users align their skills, goals, and actions into a coherent growth trajectory.

Unlike traditional career platforms that offer generic recommendations, AURA focuses on **contextual alignment** — helping users understand where they stand, why certain actions matter, and how their efforts connect over time.

---

## ✨ Key Idea

Many students and early professionals struggle not because they lack skills or ambition, but because they lack **structural clarity**.

AURA addresses this by:
- Capturing directional intent (often multi-aligned)
- Mapping skill depth and confidence
- Synthesizing goals, actions, and opportunities
- Providing adaptive guidance through an AI layer (Lyra)

---

## 🧠 Core Features

### 1. Identity Initialization (New User Flow)
- Directional focus selection (multi-aligned)
- Skill selection with proficiency levels
- Initial alignment review
- Baseline dashboard creation

### 2. Dashboard Overview
- High-level snapshot of alignment, focus, and trajectory
- Designed for clarity in seconds, not complexity

### 3. Skill Grid
- Tracks skill depth, confidence, and progress
- Skills can be reordered and reprioritized as goals evolve

### 4. Synthesis
- Connects skills, goals, and actions into a unified system
- Explains *why* certain actions matter, not just *what* to do

### 5. Discovery
- Surfaces aligned opportunities such as internships and programs
- Filtered by level, time commitment, and alignment relevance

### 6. Scheduler
- Converts strategy into execution
- Groups tasks by intent and priority

### 7. Accessibility & Intelligence Controls
- Accessibility options built into the interface
- AI controls such as reasoning depth, personalization (resonance profile), and search grounding

### 8. Lyra — AI Operating Intelligence
- Context-aware conversational layer
- Available via chat and voice
- Supports users when needed without overwhelming the core experience

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools

- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Structure: Component-based architecture
- UI Prototyping & Integration: No-code / low-code tooling
- AI Layer: Gemini (via AI Studio Interface)
- Deployment: Web-based prototype

> Note: This project prioritizes system design, interaction flow, and AI integration over low-level implementation.

## 🚧 Status & Future Scope

AURA is an early-stage prototype.

Planned expansions include:
- Recruiter-facing alignment views
- Institutional integrations (colleges, programs)
- Long-term progression analytics
- Deeper AI-driven personalization
